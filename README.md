# Installation
Search 'Midea AC LAN' in HACS and install, or copy all files in `custom_components/midea_ac_lan` from [Latest Release](https://github.com/georgezhao2010/midea_ac_lan/releases/latest) to your `/custom_components/midea_ac_lan` in Home Assistant manually. 

Restart Home Assistant.

# Configuration
After installation, search and add component Midea AC LAN in Home Assistant integrations page.

## Config automatically
This component could auto-discover and list Midea M-Smart appliances in network, select one and add it in. You could repeat the above action to add multiple devices.

***Note: Automatic configuration requires your appliances and your Home Assistant must be in the same sub-network. Otherwise, devices may not be auto-discovered.  Check this by yourself.***

## Config by IP
If auto-discover could not work, you could try to discover the appliance with the specified IP Address.

## Config manually
If you already know following information, you could add the appliance manually.
- Appliance code
- Appliance type (one of [Supported appliances](README.md#supported-appliances))
- IP address
- Port (default 6444)
- Protocol version
- Token
- Key


## Extra sensor and switch entities
